## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **16.x**
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

>  :warning: Note: **Node.js** with higher versions may not work for now. (https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/10844)

## Setup

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn install
```

- Make a copy of the `.env.example` file as `.env` and fill out the required fields.

## Development

```sh
# serve with hot reload at localhost
yarn run dev

# serve with hot reload on local network
yarn run dev:host
```

- For a detailed explanation of each directory, check out the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Build for production

### Static hosting with SSG (recommended)

```sh
# Build the application (if needed), generate every route as a HTML file and statically export to dist/ directory (used for static hosting).
yarn run generate

# serve the dist/ directory like your static hosting would do (Netlify, Vercel, Surge, etc), great for testing before deploying.
yarn run serve
```

### Server hosting with SSR

```sh
# Build and optimize your application with webpack for production.
yarn run build

# Start the production server (after running nuxt build). Use it for Node.js hosting like Heroku, Digital Ocean, etc.
yarn run start
```
